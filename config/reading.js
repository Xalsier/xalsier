    mini: "This is the first book I picked up to learn about communism in my research studies to write Eun-byul, although it really is more about philosophy. It's a very accessible read and has a lot of interesting scenarios that give the author an excuse (or launching point) to explore a different philosophical subject."

    mini: "I really like Imani Barbarin's reading of this. I picked it up with an interest to learn a little bit about the veteran that went through psychosurgery that resulted in lifelong disablement. There were also some historical events mentioned in this book such as the 504 Sit in, and the articles written by the Black Panther Party, that I had no idea about until I listened to the audiobook."
