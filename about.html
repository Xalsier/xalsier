  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Personal Life</h2>

  <br>

<p style="padding:20px;line-height:2em;font-size: 1.2em;;">I was born in Boca Raton, Florida, Boca Memorial Hospital on 1 Feb 2003, roughly around the time of the challenger shuttle explosion. For most of my early life I lived in Pompano Beach which gave me fairly easy access to a view of the coast.
</p>

<p style="padding:20px;line-height:2em;font-size: 1.2em;;">At Pompano Beach High School, I participated in two theatre productions. The first I'm not sure of the name, but the second was She Kills Monsters where I played as Orcus. I graduated in 2021 and would go on to focus on writing and digital art.</p>

<p style="padding:20px;line-height:2em;font-size: 1.2em;;">Around the same year, I changed my name from Michael to Xalsier, partly for branding reasons as I wanted a unique name that would help others identify my work. It also is an anagram of Asriel, as I really liked the fluffy goat character of the same name.</p>

<p style="padding:20px;line-height:2em;font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 200px;">After 2022, I would go on to start uploading furry artwork more frequently to sites on social media. By 2025, roughly 200 pieces worked on by me were drawn. </p>
